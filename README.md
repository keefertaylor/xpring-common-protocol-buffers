# Xpring Common Protocol Buffers

The Xpring Common Protocol Buffers Library provides common protocol buffer objects to all client side libraries in the XRP SDK. This library is built to be consumed as a submodule to other libraries, rather than a standalone library. 

Developers should use one of the following top-level libraries for accessing the Xpring Platform:
- [XpringJS](http://github.com/xpring-eng/xpring-js): A JavaScript interface for the Xpring Platform
- [XpringKit](http://github.com/xpring-eng/xpringkit): A Swift interface for the Xpring Platform
